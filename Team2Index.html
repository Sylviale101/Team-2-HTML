    <head><!--Mark's comment 7/9: Within the html tag are the head and body tags. Each is a separate section of the document and shouldn't be nested in each other so move the head tag out to before line 3 where you have the body tag. It's possible you're confusing the head tag with the header tag. Headers DO go into bodies and define the top of a page but aren't necessary to use.-->
        <!--Sylvia - Changed the heading type-->
        <!--Sylvia - Testing font size on title--><!--Mark's comment 7/9: Changing style of the title won't do anything since everything in the head won't appear on the page. The title appears as the tab name, but I don't think browsers support styling the tab text. -->

        <font size="+4"><title>Welcome to Team 2's HTML Index page</title></font><!--Mark's comment 7/9: Using the font tag is okay for this HTML assignment, but once you start doing CSS, please replace it with CSS styles. The font tag was dropped with HTML 5.-->

Also, since I mentioned it, you should rename Team2Index.html to index.html-->
