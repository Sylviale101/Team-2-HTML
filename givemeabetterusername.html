    <head><!--Mark's comment: Same issue with the Team2Index.html page: Within the html tag are the head and body tags. Each is a separate section of the document and shouldn't be nested in each other so move the head tag out to before line 3 where you have the body tag. It's possible you're confusing the head tag with the header tag. Headers DO go into bodies and define the top of a page but aren't necessary to use.-->

That way, when a screen reader tells someone the words in a link, it's more useful than "here." Recommendation is to make the anchor tag <a> encapsulate the whole sentence, though, even then it's not ideal since that sentence, taken out of context, doesn't let the user know who you mean by "his".-->
