      <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my HTML. I'm going to talking to share a little bit about my background and travel history. I was born in Somalia and Grew up in Kenya and started my education there until high school. I'm a bilingual and I speak English, Somali and Swahili but since moving to the US back in 2017, I have only been speaking only Somali and English. 
    </p>
  <h2>Coding History:</h2>
  
  <p>
  I though I took a month long Java class for summer Program  back in my junior year of High school, I don't consider myself to be a coder. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>Reason Why I'm taking this course:</h2>
  <p>
  This class is Mathematical Thinking & Visualization (MTV) Major Requirements and counts towards Visualization Practic. I'm also taking class to learn and get coding skills.
