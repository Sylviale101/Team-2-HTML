        <h1>I am Shreyas</h1>
        
        <p>The main purpose of this page is to show my practice with HTML.</p>

        <h1>Headings are fun: This colon is big and bold</h1>

        <div>I'm just trying to use the sample HTML and then go in and add my own stuff to help me learn how stuff works.</h2> <!--Mark's comment 7/17: Seems to be missing an opening <h2> and a closing </div>-->
<!--This has all been updated since you last looked at my work-->
        <h3>Smaller heading: Nice for smaller topics</h3>

        <p>For any chunks of text "p" allows me to do that.</p>

        <h4>More learning..</h4>
        <p>As you can tell I am very new to this kind of work, and I usually prefer video tutorials so I don't miss steps, but this is a fun way to learn also.
        <div>This "div" helps me break up my chunks of text.</div>
        <p>Let's see if I can break up this text inside again..</p>

        <div>I did it!</div>
        <p>Cool moving on..</p>
    
        <hr>
    
        <p>^ These page breaks above are fun to use</p>

        <p>Below I am practicing making a list in HTML</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"ul" let's me declare a list style so I can do this...</li>
            <li><strong>This let's me make a list and bold certain words</strong></li>
            <li><em>This let's me italicize text.</em></li>
            <li>Now it's time to try using "ol"</li>
            <ol>"ol" centers/ indents my text..this is cool</ol>
            <li>Starting to get the hang of things</li>
        </ul>
       <hr>
        <p><strong>Now I am learning anchor and href</strong></p>
        <p>"a" is used to put a link in text to somewhere else.</p>
        <p>For practicing this I linked <a href="https://oreo.com">Oreo's</a></p>

        <p>I could also link my email and other things with this tool (<a href="mailto:shrey321@uw.edu">shrey321@uw.edu</a>).</p>

                    <p>I made the boarder width "5" for fun.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">The more "tr" and "td" I add the more rows and breaks I make.</td>
            </tr>
